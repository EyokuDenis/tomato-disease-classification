# tomato-disease-classification
This project implements a deep learning-based classifier to detect and classify tomato plant diseases based on symptoms visible on the leaves. The model is built using MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for mobile and embedded applications. The model is fine-tuned using a dataset of tomato leaf images, and it can classify common tomato plant diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and others.
